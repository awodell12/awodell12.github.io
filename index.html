<p>
	I am currently enrolled as a full-time undergraduate student in the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University, pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. This past summer I spent two months volunteering in Tanzania as a biomedical engineering technician with a program run by Engineering World Health with support from Duke engage. The summer after freshman year I did a study abroad program in Costa Rica that helped me move from intermediate to advanced Spanish fluency.

Prior work experience includes three summers life guarding and teaching swim lessons. I am an Eagle Scout and love the outdoors. My main involvement on campus is the Men's Rowing Team. I also volunteer with Girls Engineering Change.
